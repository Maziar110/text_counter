Digitalmint COO Don Wyper pointed out that “Tesla has about $20 billion in cash or cash equivalents on their balance sheet, so the volatility of $1.5b would have less than a 10% effect on the company.”

Bkcoin Capital co-founder Carlos Betancourt noted that Tesla’s bitcoin purchase “could become the catalyst to get bitcoin’s market cap to $1 trillion,” adding that “A company like Tesla making this move is only going to accelerate further adoption of crypto as an alternative and investable asset class.”

Lmax Group CEO David Mercer shared that his firm expects “2021 will be a year that many other big names make the official crossover into the space.” He elaborated, “We expect the trickle of institutional investment thus far to become an overwhelming flood in the rest of 2021 and beyond,” stating.
